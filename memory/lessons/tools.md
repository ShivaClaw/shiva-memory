# Lessons — Tools

## Secrets hygiene
- Never write API keys/tokens into memory logs or reflections. If a key appears in a note, redact it immediately.

## Tool quirks
- `openclaw` may resolve to a stale binary if invoked via `/usr/local/bin/openclaw`; prefer `/data/.npm-global/bin/openclaw` for shell diagnostics until cleanup is done
- Config changes via gateway patch trigger restart automatically
- Memory search is useful, but retrieval quality depends on how well files are structured and maintained

## Reliable usage patterns
- Use explicit binary paths when diagnosing version/path conflicts
- Use cron JSON/list output to inspect live job definitions rather than inferring from session artifacts
- Use layered files for memory rather than overloading `MEMORY.md`
- LCM tools (lcm_grep, lcm_describe) require conversationId or allConversations=true; context-less calls fail silently

## Friction points
- Old and new OpenClaw installs can coexist and create misleading diagnostics
- Session history can make duplicate cron runs look more pathological than they are
- Schema lookup may be shallow or unhelpful for some config paths

## Notes to remember
- Distinguish gateway health from CLI shadowing
- Prefer non-destructive environmental diagnosis before changing binaries
- OpenRouter API key must be lowercase: `sk-or-v1-...` (not `Sk-or-v1-...`)
- Mistral Small 3.2 correct model ID on OR: `mistralai/mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct`
- Free-tier OR models (step-3.5-flash:free) go rate-limited without warning — unreliable as last resort
- gpt-5.2 requires `max_completion_tokens` not `max_tokens`
